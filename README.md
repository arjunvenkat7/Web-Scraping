# Web-Scraping
Repository for web scraping based projects
So the main idea here is to scrape headlines from news websites wire.in and firstpost.com
Wire doesnt have any restictions on scraping data, since the robots.txt was missing. Firstpost has certain restrictions,
but we will not be accessing those areas.
So I scrape all the headlines adn store it onto a notepad. One reason for doing this is to avoid advertisements and annoying pop ups.
Further updates for this project would be adding news from newsminute.com and quint.in, Once I am done with scraping and handling data
I will be perfroming NLP to analyse the sentiments of news published. Analysis will be extended to website by website.
Visually I can also compare about priorities given to news articles by each website.
