# Web-Scraping

Repository for web scraping based projects 

## Project1- Scraping News data

So the main idea here is to scrape headlines from news websites wire.in and firstpost.com Wire doesnâ€™t have any restrictions on scraping data, since the robots.txt was missing. Firstpost has certain restrictions, but we will not be accessing those areas. So I scrape all the headlines and store it onto a notepad. One reason for doing this is to avoid advertisements and annoying pop ups. Further updates for this project would be adding news from newsminute.com and quint.in, Once I am done with scraping and handling data I will be performing NLP to analyse the sentiments of news published. Analysis will be extended to website by website. Visually I can also compare about priorities given to news articles by each website. Look onto file News_articles.py and News data for the output obtained.

## Project 2: Scraping Menu from Local pizza store, to analyse the toppings used

Added new Web scraping project which I am doing currently I Am analysing toppings data from a local pizza store's website situated in Tampere Finland. Though I am using selenium actions to change language, the output is still in Finnish. I am looking onto the issue to sort it out. After fetching the menu, I am performing certain manipulations to take out only the toppings. Based on my preliminary analysis, 

## Top three most commonly used toppings:

* Kinkku - Ham - It is used in 15 different Pizzas 
* Aurajuusto - Blue Cheese - It is used in 12 different Pizzas 
* Katkarapu - Shrimp - It is used in 11 different Pizzas

## Least commonly used toppings: 

Chilli Pepper, Banana are used only in one pizza Note there are additional data to the above list which I will update in next version of the code For further information look onto the file pizza.py
